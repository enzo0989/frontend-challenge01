## My process

So, this is the first project that i do on my own and i i took the next steps to make it:
1) first, i looked at the designs to decide how would i write the structure, how many div's i would need and what classes could i create to reuse some styles later.
2) once i was satisfied with my ideas i started to write the HTML.
3) once that was done i started to write the CSS, first a simple reset for the styles that come with the browser and variables for the colors.
4) and finally, i wrote all the styles for the different elements of the page.   

I may have wrote it like it was a really linear process but in reality it was more like jumping between different steps to edit or add something that i haven't though in the first time that i did that part, then, go back to the part that i was working in the first place, find something else that i wanted to change, change it and repeat this process till i finished all.  
### Built with

- basic HTML
- vanilla CSS variables
- flexbox


### What I learned

In this challenge in particular i learned how do hsl and hsla work, i used to only use colors with rgb or rgba but this time i wanted to expand a little bit and learned how do hsl works. It ain't much but i'm happy about it. Also, i learned how to make animations which it's great, in the past i used to look at animations and think that they were something difficult to make but they weren't that hard, at least at this point in my development.


### Continued development

I would love to learn how to use javaScript in the future, i think that would add a nice touch to a component like this and also CSS Grid, i have the feeling that something could have been made more easily with that tool.
